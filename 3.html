            JavaScript often abbreviated as JS,
            is a programming language that is 
            one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, 
            alongside HTML and CSS. 
            As of 2022, 98% of websites use 
            JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, 
            often incorporating third-party libraries. 
            All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
            engine to execute the code on users' devices.
